/**
 * Event class representing operations performed on DataObjects.
 *
 * This event is dispatched whenever a significant operation occurs on a DataObject,
 * such as creation, updates, deletion, or versioning operations. It captures key
 * information about the operation including:
 *
 * - The ID of the affected DataObject
 * - The class of the DataObject
 * - The type of operation performed
 * - The version number (for versioned objects)
 * - The ID of the member who performed the operation
 * - The timestamp when the operation occurred
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```php
 * $event = DataObjectEvent::create(
 *     get_class($dataObject),
 *     $dataObject->ID,
 *     Operation::UPDATE,
 *     $dataObject->Version,
 *     Security::getCurrentUser()?->ID
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @template T of DataObject
